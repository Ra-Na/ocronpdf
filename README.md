# ocronpdf

It requires
- easyocr with all dependencies
- imagemagick
- pdfimages

This is a simple python3 script that ocrs a pdf with a transparent text overlay, assuming one page-sized images per page.
It works for me, but does not handle edge cases and bad input. Hence it is malable to your needs, or may be considered a starting point for a more elaborate version.
